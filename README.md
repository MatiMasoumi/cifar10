 9. License ## Project Overview The goal of this project is to classify images into one of 10 categories (e.g., airplane, automobile, bird, cat). The project includes:
 10. - Preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset. - Training a CNN model. - Evaluating performance with metrics like accuracy and loss.
 - Visualizing results such as confusion matrices and sample predictions. ## Dataset Description -
 -  **Source:** [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) - **Classes:** Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck.
 - **Training Images:** 50,000 - **Testing Images:** 10,000 - **Image Size:** 32x32 pixels, RGB format. ## Model Architecture The implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consists of
 : - **Convolutional Layers:** To extract features. - **Pooling Layers:** To reduce spatial dimensions. - **Dense Layers:** For classification.
 - **Activation Functions:** ReLU and Softmax. ## Setup Instructions ### Requirements Install the required dependencies using: ```bash pip install -r requirements.txt
